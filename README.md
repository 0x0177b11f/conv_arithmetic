# Convolution arithmetic

A technical report on convolution arithmetic in the context of deep learning.

## Generating the animations

From the repository's root directory:

``` bash
$ ./bin/generate_makefile
$ make all_animations
```

The animations will be output to the `gif` directory. Individual animation steps will be output in PDF format to the `pdf` directory and in PNG format to the `png` directory.
